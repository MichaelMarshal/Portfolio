This is a modern portfolio website built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project follows these patterns and conventions:

## Project Structure
- Uses Next.js 15 App Router with the `src/` directory structure
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling with responsive design
- Components are organized in `src/components/` directory
- Pages use the App Router pattern in `src/app/`

## Design Guidelines
- Modern, clean design with a professional look
- Dark theme support with smooth transitions
- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Consistent spacing and typography using Tailwind utilities

## Component Patterns
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's breakpoint prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
- Include proper alt text for images and ARIA labels where needed

## Portfolio Sections
The website includes these main sections:
1. **Hero Section**: Profile image, name, title, and brief introduction
2. **About Section**: Detailed professional background
3. **Skills Section**: Technology icons and skill levels
4. **Experience Section**: Work experience timeline
5. **Education Section**: Academic background
6. **Projects Section**: Portfolio projects with descriptions and links
7. **Contact Section**: Contact form and social media links
8. **Footer**: Additional links and copyright

## Styling Preferences
- Use Tailwind CSS utilities instead of custom CSS when possible
- Implement hover states and transitions for interactive elements
- Use consistent color scheme throughout the site
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Use proper spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, etc.)

## Best Practices
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement proper SEO with metadata
